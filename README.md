About LASS
----------
Writing CSS files comes with a lot of repetition and is generally much too verbose. With lispy syntax, shortcuts, and improvements, LASS aims to help you out in writing CSS quick and easy. LASS was largely inspired by [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).

How To
------
LASS supports two modes, one being directly in your lisp code, the other in pure LASS files. Adding LASS into your code is easy:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(div
   :background black))

"div{
    background: black;
}"
```

LASS works on the following simple principles: A list is a block. The first argument in the list is a selector. The body of the list makes up the properties and sub-blocks. A property is started with a keyword that is used as the property name. Following is a bunch of property arguments until a new keyword, list, or the end is reached. A list inside a block is, again, a block with the twist that the parent block's selector is prepended to the sub-block's selector.

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(nav
   (ul
    :list-style none
    (li
     :margin 0 :padding 0
     :display inline-block)))))

"nav ul{
    list-style: none;
}

nav ul li{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    display: inline-block;
}"
```

Since LASS' `COMPILE-SHEET` simply takes a bunch of lists as its argument, you can use the backquote and comma to integrate variables from your lisp environment:

```
(let ((color "#0088EE"))
  (lass:compile-and-write
   `(div
     :background ,color))))

"div{
    background: #0088EE;
}"
```

Alternatively however, and this is especially useful in pure LASS files, you can use the `LET` block to create LASS-specific bindings:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(:let ((color "#0088EE"))
   (div
    :background #(color))))

"div{
    background: #0088EE;
}"
```

LASS' selector mechanism is very flexible and allows for some complex logic to reduce duplication:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(article
   ((:or p blockquote)
    :margin 0 :padding 0

    (a
     :color black)
      
    ((:and a :hover)
     :color darkred))))

"article p, article blockquote{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

article p a, article blockquote a{
    color: black;
}

article p a:hover, article blockquote a:hover{
    color: darkred;
}"
```

But it can go even further:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '((:and
    (:or article section)
    (:= data-author (:or yukari ran chen))
    (:nth-child (:or 1 2 3)))
   :display none))

"article[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(1),
 article[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(2),
 article[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(3),
 article[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(1),
 article[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(2),
 article[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(3),
 article[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(1),
 article[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(2),
 article[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(3),
 section[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(1),
 section[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(2),
 section[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(3),
 section[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(1),
 section[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(2),
 section[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(3),
 section[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(1),
 section[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(2),
 section[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(3){
    display: none;
}"
```

Whoa nelly!

Some CSS properties are not fully specified yet and require browser-specific prefixes. LASS can help you with that, too:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(.fun
   :linear-gradient "deg(45)" black 0% darkgray 100%
   :transform rotate -45deg))

".fun{
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    background: -o-linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    background: -ms-linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    background: linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    -moz-transform: rotate(-45deg);
    -o-transform: rotate(-45deg);
    -webkit-transform: rotate(-45deg);
    -ms-transform: rotate(-45deg);
    transform: rotate(-45deg);
}"
```

LASS also supports the various `@QUERY` operator blocks:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(:media "(max-width: 800px)"
   (div
    :margin 0)))

"@media (max-width: 800px){
    div{
        margin: 0;
    }
}"
```

By default LASS activates pretty-printing and inserts newlines and spaces where appropriate in order to make the result readable and easy to debug. However, you can also deactivate that and directly produce minified CSS:

```
(let ((lass:*pretty* NIL))
  (lass:compile-and-write
   '(:media "(max-width: 800px)"
     (div
      :margin 0))))

"@media (max-width: 800px){div{margin:0;}}"
```

As mentioned above you can write pure LASS files to compile down to a CSS file. To do that, simply use `GENERATE`:

Extending LASS
--------------
Pretty much every part of LASS is extensible through methods. Most useful will however probably be the `DEFINE-SPECIAL-PROPERTY`, `DEFINE-BROWSER-PROPERTY` and `DEFINE-SPECIAL-SELECTOR` helper-macros. Here's some examples from the `SPECIAL.LISP` file that defines some standard special handlers:

```
(define-special-property font-family (&rest faces)
  (list (make-property "font-family" (format NIL "狺蕃" (mapcar #'resolve faces)))))

(define-browser-property linear-gradient (direction &rest colors)
  (:default (property)
    (make-property "background" (format NIL "a(a狺痱镳弪豉蝈箫祧溟蝈泗轱瞟磲疸狎＇蝈箫祧泔祜蝮┅┅噜骑盹蝈泔铘蝻飕栳鲥祜镫狒翳鲠蜷秕嗝贤猩膛珏铄蜷骢钽糸镱螽彭徙吁痧矧塘佑轭沆蹁弩糸铢屐轶骈戾囔狍螽屐喈龄塘佑溟蝈泗矧麸秕屙徙嗵狭沫辛匀犷嘁叛丈遗灬篌噜ㄡ滗麸扉篝ъ镝洵疳翳③疳翳麸灬篌箫躜沐溟蜉蝈聃轵ъ狍螬噜项沐秕鲩箝喈灬篌骈戾轸鏖祆狨麸磲糸汜祆篝狎轭翳嗵劣余磲觑颦盹溴麒殂轶溴蜷鲥洵盹溴骝镯嗝贤拖苇躺有拖呐喈阻孱弼弪秕筢鲥轸鏖祆狨麸磲糸汜祆趄麸泔眇殪翳灬篌骈戾麸轸糜羼蹰鲠戾铘涉箪轫轶泔铑邈翦洮轸鏖祆趄麸聃殂腱镝塘佑犷弼犰踽翦嗲盼乓猎培涉箪轫轶铒泔铑邈翦洮轸轭篝遽屮邈豸弩箬屐泔眄犷洚深矧溴骘翳狒麸黠螂翳坂灬篌忾钺蝙莰梏麴蠛玳翳踱泔懑予轭礤蜥塘佑蝈戾狍弩眭篝忮轭秕疳翳涉秕镳弪狒轭簌篝屙轶铒溟蝈泗禊篚痧矧翦鏖翳忾钺蝙秕汜怩殪轸秕蝮屐躞轭怩殪麸镬扉脲勐蹰熹狃疠ㄨ趑鸷鼢鳟徙璁泔懑扉箴怩殪溽痧┈翳劣钠簌篝屙嗦晌烈侪塘佑犷翳孱趄痫轭嗦晌烈侪塘佑好湍滓列信亦劣钠深翦珧狒轱涉秕麽铘麸泔眇殪塘佑骈戾麸糜轭秕簌篝屙蟋秕汜铒霭传滹翳轶鲩囔狍蟓骈戾泔眇镱孱豉疱犷嗪溴骟篝屙溴疱钿蟓镱喹轭塘佑噜ㄡ箐婧溴骟篝屙睐簌篝屙轰彐簌篝屙溴疱钿蟓镱ê灬篌恒镯痫铄铘è红狍蟓骈戾Ⅳ弩舡骈戾┅噜亠汜犰箫箴邈殒犷嗪秕麴豸狎珲礤铘麸囔狍蟓骈戾麸箴邈殒麒狒翳翎蜱弭泱骈戾箬秕熹忮
