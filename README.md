About LASS
----------
Writing CSS files comes with a lot of repetition and is generally much too verbose. With lispy syntax, shortcuts, and improvements, LASS aims to help you out in writing CSS quick and easy. LASS was largely inspired by [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).

How To
------
LASS supports two modes, one being directly in your lisp code, the other in pure LASS files. Adding LASS into your code is easy:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(div
   :background black))

"div{
    background: black;
}"
```

LASS works on the following simple principles: A list is a block. The first argument in the list is a selector. The body of the list makes up the properties and sub-blocks. A property is started with a keyword that is used as the property name. Following is a list of property arguments until a new keyword, list, or the end is reached. A list inside a block is, again, a block with the twist that the parent block's selector is prepended to the sub-block's selector.

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(nav
   (ul
    :list-style none
    (li
     :margin 0 :padding 0
     :display inline-block)))))

"nav ul{
    list-style: none;
}

nav ul li{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    display: inline-block;
}"
```

Since LASS' `COMPILE-SHEET` simply takes a bunch of lists as its argument, you can use the backquote and comma to integrate variables from your lisp environment:

```
(let ((color "#0088EE"))
  (lass:compile-and-write
   `(div
     :background ,color))))

"div{
    background: #0088EE;
}"
```

Alternatively however, and this is especially useful in pure LASS files, you can use the `LET` block to create LASS-specific bindings:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(:let ((color "#0088EE"))
   (div
    :background #(color))))

"div{
    background: #0088EE;
}"
```

LASS' selector mechanism is very flexible and allows for some complex logic to reduce duplication:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(article
   ((:or p blockquote)
    :margin 0 :padding 0

    (a
     :color black)
      
    ((:and a :hover)
     :color darkred))))

"article p, article blockquote{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

article p a, article blockquote a{
    color: black;
}

article p a:hover, article blockquote a:hover{
    color: darkred;
}"
```

But it can go even further:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '((:and
    (:or article section)
    (:= data-author (:or yukari ran chen))
    (:nth-child (:or 1 2 3)))
   :display none))

"article[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(1),
 article[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(2),
 article[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(3),
 article[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(1),
 article[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(2),
 article[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(3),
 article[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(1),
 article[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(2),
 article[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(3),
 section[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(1),
 section[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(2),
 section[data-author=\"yukari\"]:nth-child(3),
 section[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(1),
 section[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(2),
 section[data-author=\"ran\"]:nth-child(3),
 section[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(1),
 section[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(2),
 section[data-author=\"chen\"]:nth-child(3){
    display: none;
}"
```

Whoa nelly!

Some CSS properties are not fully specified yet and require browser-specific prefixes. LASS can help you with that, too:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(.fun
   :linear-gradient "deg(45)" black 0% darkgray 100%
   :transform rotate -45deg))

".fun{
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    background: -o-linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    background: -ms-linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    background: linear-gradient(deg(45), black 0%, darkgray 100%);
    -moz-transform: rotate(-45deg);
    -o-transform: rotate(-45deg);
    -webkit-transform: rotate(-45deg);
    -ms-transform: rotate(-45deg);
    transform: rotate(-45deg);
}"
```

LASS also supports the various `@QUERY` operator blocks:

```
(lass:compile-and-write
 '(:media "(max-width: 800px)"
   (div
    :margin 0)))

"@media (max-width: 800px){
    div{
        margin: 0;
    }
}"
```

By default LASS activates pretty-printing and inserts newlines and spaces where appropriate in order to make the result readable and easy to debug. However, you can also deactivate that and directly produce minified css:

```
(let ((lass:*pretty* NIL))
  (lass:compile-and-write
   '(:media "(max-width: 800px)"
     (div
      :margin 0))))

"@media (max-width: 800px){div{margin:0;}}"
```

As mentioned above you can write pure LASS files to compile down to a CSS file. To do that, simply use `GENERATE`:

Extending LASS
--------------
Pretty much every part of LASS is extensible through methods. Most useful will however probably be the `DEFINE-SPECIAL-PROPERTY`, `DEFINE-BROWSER-PROPERY` and `DEFINE-SPECIAL-SELECTOR` helper-macros. Here's some examples from the `SPECIAL.LISP` file that defines some standard special handlers:

```
(define-special-property font-family (&rest faces)
  (list (make-property "font-family" (format NIL "狺蕃" (mapcar #'resolve faces)))))

(define-browser-property linear-gradient (direction &rest colors)
  (:default (property)
    (make-property "background" (format NIL "a(a狺痱镳弪豉蝈箫祧溟蝈泗轱瞟磲疸狎＇蝈箫祧泔祜蝮┅┅噜骑盹蝈泔铘蝻飕栳鲥祜镫狒翳鲠蜷秕嗝贤猩膛珏铄蜷骢钽糸镱螽
